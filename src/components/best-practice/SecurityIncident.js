            <h3 style={styles.subheading}>What is Security Incident Handling?</h3>
            <p style={styles.text}>
                Security Incident Handling involves the processes and actions taken by a company to identify, respond to, and manage security breaches or threats. It is crucial for minimizing the impact of incidents on the business and ensuring a swift recovery.
            </p>

            <h3 style={styles.subheading}>Why is Security Incident so Important?</h3>
            <p style={styles.text}>
                A company faced a data breach due to a phishing attack. By following its incident response plan, the company quickly isolated the affected systems, notified stakeholders, and mitigated the damage by patching vulnerabilities and restoring services.

            <ul style={styles.list}>
                <li><strong>Develop an Incident Response Plan:</strong> Outline steps to take when an incident occurs, including roles, communication protocols, and escalation paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Regularly Train Employees:</strong> Ensure staff is aware of their roles during a security incident and conduct regular simulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor and Detect:</strong> Use monitoring tools to identify suspicious activities early and prevent them from escalating.</li>
                <li><strong>Conduct Post-Incident Reviews:</strong> Analyze the incident response to identify lessons learned and improve future responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage External Experts:</strong> Have contacts with external security experts who can assist during major incidents.</li>
